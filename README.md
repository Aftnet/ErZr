My very own Lumines clone; as I had forgotten my PSP back home where I wasn't going to be able to pick it up for months and I was experimenting with GBA development, the game was born out of necessity (yes, I was addicted to Mizuguchi's masterpiece, have been clean for over two years now though :P).

Basic gameplay principles being the same, there are some major differences in the way block clearing and combos work (couldn't replicate the original system); also, I found it somewhat difficult to continue development once the game became playable.

All background images were taken from places around the internet (with special thanks to Deviantart).

## Controls:
Use A and B to rotate blocks, Down arrow to drop them.

## System Requirements
A system capable of running one of the many Game Boy Advance emulators available (google for them, otherwise [NGemu](http://www.ngemu.com/) is a good place to start), or a GBA flash cart (don't know much about them myself and the game has never been tested this way, so anything could happen).
