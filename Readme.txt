Controls:
Use A and B to rotate blocks, Down arrow to drop them.

System Requirements
A system capable of running one of the many Game Boy Advance emulators available (google for them, otherwise <a href=”http://www.ngemu.com/gba”>this</a> is a good place to start), or a GBA flash cart (don’t know much about them myself and the game has never been tested this way, so anything could happen).
